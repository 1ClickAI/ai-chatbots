## üîß Webhook Integration

### Configuring the Webhook

![OneChat API](https://i.imgur.com/dPUIemq.png)

The system allows you to configure a webhook URL and an API key through the interface. These inputs are essential for enabling real-time communication between your bot and external systems.

#### Input Form:
- **Webhook URL**: Enter the URL of your webhook endpoint.
- **Webhook ApiKey**: Enter the API key to secure communication with your webhook.

### JSON Payloads

#### Outgoing Request

When the bot sends a request to your webhook, it will include the following JSON payload:

```json
{
    "platform": "<platform>",
    "id": "<id>",
    "user": "<user>",
    "message": "<message>"
}
```

- `platform`: The platform the message originates from. Possible values are:
  - `whatsapp`
  - `discord`
  - `telegram`
- `id`: A unique identifier for the conversation or interaction.
- `user`: Information about the user (e.g., user ID or contact information).
- `message`: The content of the message to be processed.

#### Authentication Header

Every request includes an `Authorization` header for security:

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer <webhook_key>
```

The `<webhook_key>` corresponds to the API key you provided during webhook configuration.

#### Expected Webhook Response

The webhook should return the following JSON payload:

```json
{
    "message": "Hello World!"
}
```

- `message`: The text the bot will send as a response to the user.

### Bot Behavior

Once the webhook responds with the `message` field, the bot will reply to the user with the specified text. For example:

1. If your webhook sends back:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "Hello World!"
    }
    ```

2. The bot replies to the user with:
    ```
    Hello World!
    ```

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that your webhook is capable of handling and responding to the outlined JSON structure.
- The `Authorization` header must be validated on your webhook server to ensure secure communication.
- The bot will not proceed with a response if the webhook fails to respond or returns an invalid format.
